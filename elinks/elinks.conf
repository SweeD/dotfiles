## ELinks 0.11.7 configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so; this file is edited by ELinks when you save
## options through UI, however only option values will be altered
## and missing options will be added at the end of file; if option
## is not written in this file, but in some file included from it,
## it is NOT counted as missing. Note that all your formatting,
## own comments and so on will be kept as-is.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

# Automatically saved options
#

## config 
#  Configuration handling options.

  ## config.saving_style_w [0|1]
  #  This is internal option used when displaying a warning about
  #  obsolete config.saving_style. You shouldn't touch it.
  set config.saving_style_w = 1


## document 
#  Document options.

  ## document.cache 
  #  Cache options.

    ## document.cache.format 
    #  Format cache options.

      ## document.cache.format.size <num>
      #  Number of cached formatted pages. Do not get too generous
      #  here, 'formatted' means that all the accompanying structures
      #  are kept in memory so that you get the cached document
      #  immediatelly, but these structures may take a lot - 2x the
      #  size of the HTML source is probably not unusual, but it can
      #  be even more if the document consists of a lot of short lines
      #  (padded right, if possible) and links and not much other markup.
      #  So if you set this to 256 and then you don't like your ELinks
      #  eating 90M, don't come complaining to us. ;-)
      #  Also note that the format cache itself is not counted to the
      #  memory cache size, but the HTML source of the formatted documents
      #  is always cached, even if it is over the memory cache size
      #  threshold. (Then of course no other documents can be cached.)
      set document.cache.format.size = 0



  ## document.colors 
  #  Default document color settings.

    ## document.colors.use_document_colors <num>
    #  Use colors specified in document:
    #  0 is use always the default settings
    #  1 is use document colors if available, except background
    #  2 is use document colors, including background. This can
    #    mostly look very impressive, but some sites will appear
    #    really ugly. Note, that obviously if the background is
    #    not black, it will break the behaviour of transparency.
    set document.colors.use_document_colors = 0



## ui 
#  User interface options.

  ## ui.language <language>
  #  Language of user interface. 'System' means that the language will
  #  be extracted from the environment dynamically.
  set ui.language = "System"
