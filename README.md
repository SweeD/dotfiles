# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are specific to my needs but if you are a Ruby, JavaScript or UNIX hacker you might find something useful here.

## Installation

You need Ruby to install the files. 

    ruby install.rb

This symlinks the dotfiles folders and files into your home folder.
